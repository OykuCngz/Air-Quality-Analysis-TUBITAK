## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to measure and analyze short-term air quality changes using **low-cost sensors**. The collected data is processed to detect patterns and anomalies, serving as my **graduation project** supported by **TÜBİTAK**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collecting real-time air quality data (PM2.5, PM10, CO2, etc.).
- Cleaning and preprocessing data using **Python**.
- Applying **Machine Learning (Regression models)** to predict pollution trends.
- Visualizing the impact of environmental factors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Regression, Neural Networks)
- **Hardware:** Low-cost IoT Sensors
